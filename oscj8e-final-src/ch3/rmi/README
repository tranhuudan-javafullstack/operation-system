Instructions for running RMI source code examples.
--------------------------------------------------

This is organized into three directories:

(1) client - which contains the RMIClient code.

(2) server - which contains the RemoteDate interface and implementation.

To run the remote date  files

SERVER
------
1. Compile all source files.

2. Start the registry (rmiregistry)

On UNIX/Linux/OS X, enter

	rmiregistry &

On Windows, enter

	start rmiregistry

4. Create the remote object 

	java RemoteDateImpl

This registers the remote date on the server with the RMI registry.

CLIENT
------

*** Make sure the RemoteDate.class file is in the client directory!!!

1. Compile RemoteDate.java

2. Start the client

	java RMIClient
