This explains how the sample programs are to be run:

1) HttpRequestMirror.java - This program demonstrates what a client web browser sends
to the server. To start this program, enter

	java HttpRequestMirror

This program listens to port 1500.

Next, enter the URL in your client browser (running on the same machine as your server):

	http://localhost:1500/

You can experiment with different URLs such as

	http://localhost:1500/docs/other.html

2) HttpHeader.java - This program demonstrates the headers returned by a web server. 
To test this program, enter

	java HttpHeader <web server> <document>

such as
	
	java HttpHeader www.xmission.com index.html
